1. Jenkins Setup Guide (Step-by-step installation and configuration)

This section is a how-to manual. It should include:

- System requirements (OS, Java version, hardware)

- Installation methods (Windows installer, Linux apt/yum, Docker, war file)

- Initial setup

- Unlocking Jenkins with initial admin password

- Installing recommended plugins

- Creating first admin user

- Configuration basics

- Setting global tools (JDK, Node.js, Git)

- Setting up Jenkins agents/nodes

- Configuring credentials

-  Verification – run a sample freestyle job


2. Pipeline Architecture Document (Explanation of pipeline design decisions)

This section explains why your pipeline looks the way it does. For example:

- Pipeline Type: Declarative vs Scripted pipeline – why you chose it

- Stages: (e.g., Environment Setup → Build → Test → Deploy → Notifications)

- Parallelization: Running Chrome and Edge tests in parallel

- Smart test selection: Smoke tests on weekdays, regression on weekends

- Resource management: Dedicated agents for browsers, lock mechanism for heavy tests

- Post actions: Always archive reports, send notifications


3. Troubleshooting Guide (Common issues and solutions)

This is a FAQ / issue-resolution section. 
Example entries:

1.  Problem: Cypress binary missing in Jenkins →
    Solution: Run npx cypress install in Jenkins environment or cache Cypress binary.

2.  Problem: Builds stuck in queue →
    Solution: Use disableConcurrentBuilds() or set up multiple agents.

3.  Problem: Browser not launching →
    Solution: Ensure browser binaries installed on agent, or run with --browser chrome.

4.  Problem: Report files missing →
    Solution: Add junit reporter config and check archiveArtifacts path.

5.  Problem: Slack notification not working →
    Solution: Verify webhook URL, check Jenkins firewall access.


4. Scaling Strategy (How to expand for enterprise use)

This is a forward-looking plan. Include:

- Horizontal scaling: Add more Jenkins agents/nodes (Windows/Linux/Docker)

- Load distribution: Use Jenkins master only for orchestration, run builds on agents

i)Pipeline optimization:

- Run smoke tests first for fast feedback

- Parallelize regression tests across agents

- Retry failed flaky tests automatically

- Enterprise integrations:

- Connect with GitHub/GitLab for CI/CD

- Integrate with Slack/MS Teams for notifications

- Store reports in S3/Nexus/Artifactory

- Security & maintenance:

- Role-based access control

- Regular plugin & Jenkins updates

- Backup strategies
